# Chance-Constrained Optimization


The problem of interest is a chance-constrained problem that may be formulated as follows:

    min‚Çì { f(x) : x ‚àà X,  P[G(x, Œæ) ‚â§ 0] ‚â§ Œ± }

Let p(x) = P[G(x, Œæ) ‚â§ 0], and note that the empirical probability distribution P_N may be used to estimate P.  
For realizations Œæ‚ÇÅ, Œæ‚ÇÇ, ..., Œæ_N of Œæ:

    pÃÇ_N(x) := P_N[G(x, Œæ) ‚â§ 0] = (1 / N) ‚àë_{i=1}^{N} ùüô_{(-‚àû, 0]}[G(x, Œæ·µ¢)]

The Sample Average Approximation (SAA) method to solve the above chance-constrained problem is generally formulated as:

    min‚Çì { f(x) : x ‚àà X,  P_N[G(x, Œæ) ‚â§ 0] ‚â§ Œ≥ }


This repository demonstrates an implementation of chance constrained portfolio allocation using the Sample Average Approximation (SAA) method for chance-constrained programming. The approach and methodology are based on the paper:  
["Sample Average Approximation Method for Chance Constrained Programming: Theory and Applications"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10957-009-9523-6).
