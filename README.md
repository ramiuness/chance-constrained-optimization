# Chance-Constrained Optimization

Chance-constrained portfolio optimization provides a structured way to make investment decisions under uncertainty. Rather than requiring rigid constraints, it ensures key objectives‚Äîsuch as achieving a target return‚Äîare met with high confidence. This method closely aligns with modern risk management practices by incorporating Value-at-Risk (VaR) principles directly into the portfolio construction process, enabling more resilient and realistic strategies in volatile markets.
 
This repository demonstrates an implementation of chance constrained portfolio allocation using the Sample Average Approximation (SAA) method for chance-constrained programming. The approach and methodology are based on the paper:  
["Sample Average Approximation Method for Chance Constrained Programming: Theory and Applications"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10957-009-9523-6).
